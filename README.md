## Hi there, I'm Mickey! 👋
I'm a software engineer turned ecosystem builder, working at the intersection of technology and social impact.

Since 2012, **Python** has been at the center of my journey—not just as a programming language, but as a community I’ve chosen to serve. That commitment keeps me asking: **what do I need to become to serve this community better?** The answer has taken me from writing code to building systems, from organizing events to shaping sustainable pathways for others.

- 🔭 I'm currently a Program Coordinator at **Ateneo Technical Resource Lab (TRL)** — working on **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** for inclusive identity, payments, and data exchange
- 🌱 I’m learning entrepreneurship and data-driven sustainability to strengthen both grassroots open-source communities and GovTech ecosystems.
- 👯 Open to collaborations on open source and Python community initiatives that grow leadership and resilience.
- 🤝 At **[PythonPH](https://python.ph)** — leading sponsorships, financial sustainability, and succession planning through **Kaizend** (training leaders, preventing burnout, sustaining morale)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m an introvert, but I thrive when surrounded by people who care deeply about their craft and communities.

## Tech Community Contributions
- I co-founded PythonPH in 2013. I spend a lot of my free time as a volunteer doing admin work, handling overall operations, coaching and mentoring the next gen leaders, and organizing events for the community.
- I'm a [PSF Fellow member](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/08/python-software-foundation-fellow.html) since 2019
