## Hi there, I'm Mickey! 👋
I'm a **software engineer turned ecosystem builder**, working at the intersection of technology and social impact.

I’ve worked on various types of projects and have used multiple programming languages, but in 2012 I fell in love with Python and its community.

Since 2012, several amazing things happened and **Python** has been at the center of my journey—not just as a programming language, but as a community I’ve chosen to serve. That commitment keeps me asking: **what do I need to become to serve this community better?** The answer has taken me from writing code to building systems, from organizing events to shaping people-centered systems that make it easier for others to plug in.

- 🔭 I'm currently a **Program Coordinator at Ateneo Technical Resource Lab (TRL)** — working on **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** for inclusive identity, payments, and data exchange
- 🌱 I’m learning **entrepreneurship** and **data-driven leadership** to strengthen both grassroots open-source communities and GovTech ecosystems.
- 👯 Open to collaborations on open source and Python community initiatives that grow leadership and resilience.
- 🤝 At **[PythonPH](https://python.ph)**, I lead **sponsorships**, **financial sustainability**, and **succession planning** through **Kaizend**, our core volunteer training program that develops technical skills, soft skills, and life skills (while preventing burnout and sustaining morale).
- 👩‍💻 I’m also a Mentor/Advisor at **[PyLadies Manila](https://pyladiesmanila.github.io)**, supporting women in Python through mentorship and by building safe spaces for them with events and programs made especially for them.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m an **introvert**, but I thrive when surrounded by people who care deeply about their craft and communities.

## Tech Community Contributions
- I co-founded PythonPH in 2013. I spend a lot of my free time as a volunteer doing admin work, handling overall operations, coaching and mentoring the next gen leaders, and organizing events for the community.
- I've been a [PSF Fellow member](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/08/python-software-foundation-fellow.html) since 2019
